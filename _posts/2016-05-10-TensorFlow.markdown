These are good instructions [here](http://ramhiser.com/2016/01/05/installing-tensorflow-on-an-aws-ec2-instance-with-gpu-support/)
for getting CUDA libraries and updates.

You'll want to modify the docker_run_gpu.sh to allow access to the necessary 
ports.

{% highlight bash %}
docker run -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006     -it $CUDA_SO $DEVICES "$@"
{% endhighlight %}


Once it's modified, you'll want to pull down the latest tensorflow gpu version.

{% highlight bash %}

./docker_run_gpu.sh gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu

{% endhighlight %}
