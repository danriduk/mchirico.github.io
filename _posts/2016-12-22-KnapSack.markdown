Below the program will find the maximum value giving the following
weight limit W. For example, having a W=5 (weight limit of 5), what
is the maximum value?

The answer should be 5+2+2 == 9.  These are the values added up. The
5 has a weight of 3 and each 2 has a weight of 1  total weights = 3+1+1

## Fractional weights

There's another problem here, but it uses fractional weight. Note, you need to sort
the values and weights, before calling the function.
