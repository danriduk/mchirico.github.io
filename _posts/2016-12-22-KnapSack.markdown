Below the program will find the maximum value giving the following
weight limit W. For example, having a W=5 (weight limit of 5), what
is the maximum value?

The answer should be 5+2+2 == 9.  These are the values added up. The
5 has a weight of 3 and each 2 has a weight of 1  total weights = 3+1+1

def knapSack(W, wt, val, n):
    K = [[0 for x in range(W+1)] for x in range(n+1)]
 
    # Build table K[][] in bottom up manner
    for i in range(n+1):
        for w in range(W+1):
            if i==0 or w==0:
                K[i][w] = 0
            elif wt[i-1] <= w:
                K[i][w] = max(val[i-1] + K[i-1][w-wt[i-1]],  K[i-1][w])
            else:
                K[i][w] = K[i-1][w]
 
    return (K[n][W])

# Driver program to test above function
val = [5, 3, 2, 2]
wt = [3, 2, 1,1]
W = 5
n = len(val)
print(knapSack(W, wt, val, n))
