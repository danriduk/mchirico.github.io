You can get the instruction on how to do this from
the following [link](http://blog.emmatosch.com/2016/03/09/using-custom-javascript-in-jekyll-blogs.html).  It's pretty cool being able t add your own javascript.

Not that this graph has anything meaningful, but it was easy to create. 


<style type="text/css">
      #mynetwork {
      width: 600px;
      height: 400px;
      border: 1px solid lightgray;
      }
</style>


<div id="mynetwork"></div>



{% highlight python %}

{% endhighlight %}
