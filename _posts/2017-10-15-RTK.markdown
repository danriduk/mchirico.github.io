This is a beautiful written law.

> The objective of the Right to Know Law ... is to empower citizens by affording them
> access to information concerning the activities of their government."  *SWB Yankees L.L.C. v.
> Wintermantel, 45 A.3d 1029, 1041 (Pa. 2012).*  Further, this important open-government law
> is "designed to promote access to official government information in order to prohibit secrets,
> scrutinize the actions of public officials and make public officials accountable for
> their actions."

Unfortunately, it requires some knowledge to use it
effectively.  For example, it helps to review past cases to get a full
understanding of this powerful tool, and that's where technology could be helpful.
